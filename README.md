# E-commerce Backend

## Description

The refactoring of e-commerce backend code is to give me the opportunity to understand what steps are necessary in order to update/maintain code from the backend. Through this project, I get to learn how important sequelize is when creating databases that contain important information within multiple tables. I have learned how to connect tables based on primary keys using foreign keys and other forms of association. In addition, this gave me the opportunity to learn about routes and models while seeding data.

## Installation 

The user can clone the repository from github and then install Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize.js. Once those packages have been installed through terminal/command prompt, the user can then source the database information, seed data, and access the files using a third party like Insomnia. 

## Usage
Create the schema from the MySQL shell:
![Schema from MySQL Shell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xy8loSY_rqLrGF87CHPQ82Ye_QUk0dvC/view)

Seed the database from the command line:


Start the applicationâ€™s server:


GET route for all categories (in Insomnia):


GET route for all products (in Insomnia): 


GET route for all tags (in Insomnia):


GET route for a single category (in Insomnia):


GET route for a single product (in Insomnia):


GET route for a single tag (in Insomnia):


POST, PUT, and DELETE route for categories (in Insomnia):

## Contributions

I would like to thank my cohort along with my instructor and TAs for all the help they have provided throughout the course. In addition, I would like to thank those in my current team at work who have helped me better understand RESTful APIs and interface testing.
